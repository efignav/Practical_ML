Project course

Six people using accelerometers on their bodies are asked to perform barbell lifts in 5 different ways. It have been identified 5 different ways to do it, called Class A, B, C, D and E. Only the Class A is considered correct. Many measures have been taken and been registered at training dataset of more than 19,000 observations. The task is to train a model that predict correctly the Class based on relevant columns of the datasets.

R is used to train the best model that can predict the Class A outcome, given a series of measures taken by some devices that 6 people wear.

A datased composed of only 20 bservations is used to validate the best model.
